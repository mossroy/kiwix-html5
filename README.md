This is a fork of the [Kiwix-js](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js) project, mainly to test new features with a focus on "Standalone" mode on Desktop. In this mode all you need to read and search a ZIM Archive (an **offline** full archive of Wikipedia/Stackoverflow/KhanAcademy etc) is a browser. 

1. Find and download an offline archive [here](http://download.kiwix.org/)
2. Download the code [here](https://github.com/sharun-s/kiwix-html5/archive/dev.zip)  
Unzip to a folder and click on the index.html
3. Point the app at the location of the ZIM file downloaded in step 1.  
  
**Thats it!** You are ready to start browsing an offline version of Wikipedia.

The latest code is on the ["dev"](https://github.com/sharun-s/kiwix-html5/tree/dev) Branch. 

**NOTE:** This is aimed at only developers conducting experiments on the Kiwix-js repo. As these experiments mature code will be pushed back into the Kiwix-js repo. For stable more time-tested platform-specific versions checkout the main [Kiwix](https://github.com/kiwix) page       

**Browser Compatibility:**

This code has been tested on Firefox and Edge. 

For Chrome start the browser with the [--allow-file-access-from-files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18586921/how-to-launch-html-using-chrome-at-allow-file-access-from-files-mode) paramater. It's convenient to create a shortcut to Chrome with this option set.
